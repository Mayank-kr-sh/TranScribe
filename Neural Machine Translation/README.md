# Neural Machine Translation Dataset and Model

This repository contains a dataset and a Neural Machine Translation (NMT) model trained on the dataset. The NMT model is designed for translating text from one language to another.

## Dataset

The dataset in this repository consists of:

- **X_train.pkl:** Training data for the NMT model.
- **X_test.pkl:** Testing data for evaluating the NMT model.

The dataset has been preprocessed and organized to facilitate training and evaluation of the NMT model.

## NMT Model

The NMT model in this repository has been trained on the provided dataset and comes with pre-trained weights:

- **nmt_weights.h5:** Pre-trained weights for the NMT model.

## Usage

To use the NMT dataset and model, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
cd your-repo
```

### 2. Dataset Information
Explore the dataset files:

* X_train.pkl: Use this file for training the NMT model.
* X_test.pkl: Use this file for evaluating the NMT model.

### 3. NMT Model
Load the NMT model and pre-trained weights:
```bash
from your_nmt_module import NeuralMachineTranslationModel
nmt_model = NeuralMachineTranslationModel()
nmt_model.load_weights('nmt_weights.h5')  
```

### 4. Training and Evaluation
Utilize the dataset for training and evaluation:

* Train the NMT model using X_train.pkl.
* Evaluate the model performance using X_test.pkl.
  
### 5. Fine-tuning
If needed, fine-tune the NMT model or adjust hyperparameters based on your specific use case.
