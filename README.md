## Overview

This repository contains an implementation of a Transformer model, a powerful neural network architecture introduced in the paper "Attention is All You Need" by Vaswani et al. The Transformer model has achieved state-of-the-art results in various natural language processing tasks, including machine translation, text summarization, and language modeling.

## Features

Self-attention Mechanism: The model utilizes self-attention mechanisms to capture long-range dependencies in input sequences.

Multi-head Attention: Multi-head attention allows the model to focus on different parts of the input sequence simultaneously, enhancing its ability to learn complex patterns.

Positional Encoding: To incorporate the order of elements in a sequence, positional encodings are added to the input embeddings.

Feedforward Neural Network: The model includes feedforward neural networks to process information after attention mechanisms.

Layer Normalization and Residual Connections: These components are employed to stabilize and facilitate the training of deep networks.

Encoder and Decoder Architecture: The Transformer model consists of an encoder and decoder, making it suitable for sequence-to-sequence tasks.

## Dependencies

Python (>=3.6)

TensorFlow (>=2.0) or PyTorch (>=1.0)

NumPy

Matplotlib (for visualization, optional)

## Model Architecture

The Transformer model consists of the following components:

Encoder: Composed of multiple identical layers, each containing self-attention and feedforward sub-layers.

Decoder: Also composed of multiple identical layers, with additional masked self-attention layer to prevent attending to future tokens.
