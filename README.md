## English to Hindi Language Translation

Our groundbreaking project revolves around the development of an English to Hindi Language Translation system that utilizes cutting-edge natural language processing techniques. We've constructed this translation model entirely from the ground up, leveraging state-of-the-art BERT and Transformer models. The real game-changer here is our choice of data â€“ we harnessed the vast and diverse Samanantar dataset, readily available on AI4Bharat. Through the strategic fusion of these advanced technologies and extensive linguistic data, we've created a sophisticated and robust English to Hindi translation system, promising to bridge language barriers with unprecedented accuracy and fluency.
